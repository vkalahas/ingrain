# Ingrain

You write notes... and never read them again.
You make flashcards... but it's tedious and only tests rote memory.

Knowledge should be in your head, not just in your notes.

Ingrain forces you to synthesize what you know in your words so your notes are deeply ingrained in your brain.
Simply creating notes only gives you the illusion of learning.
To learn deeply, you need to *use* what you know.
